# Starbucks_promotions_Data_Analysis


### Intro 
This case study examines data given by Starbucks that mimics customer demographics and transactional activity during a promotional campaign. Customers received a variety of deals during the one-month promotion. The goal of this case study is to better analyze consumer responses to various offers in order to develop better techniques to providing them special promotional discounts. Customers are segmented based on their transactional actions so that specialized suggestions may be made for different categories to boost customer stickiness, brand recognition, and overall income. Customer segmentation also offers information on new customer targeting.

### Objective 
* What are the best methods for sending customers offers?
* What are the suggested tactics for different customer groups?

### Data
This dataset contains information about customers, including their unique ID, birth year, education level, marital status, yearly household income, number of children and teenagers in their household, date of enrollment with the company, number of days since their last purchase, and whether they have complained in the last 2 years.

It also includes information about the products they have purchased, including the amount spent on wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold in the last 2 years. The dataset also contains information about promotions, including the number of purchases made with a discount and whether the customer accepted offers in various campaigns.

In addition, the dataset includes information about the customer’s purchasing behavior, such as the number of purchases made through the company’s website, using a catalogue or directly in stores, and the number of visits to the company’s website in the last month.

The goal is to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.

### Results
#### What are the best methods for sending customers offers?
Offers not only increase income, but they also increase customer stickiness. Because the impact of each individual offer is fleeting, the company should send offers to customers on a regular basis to help form purchasing habits.

To increase the efficacy (total offer completion rate) of offers, the organization should work to increase both the offer view rate and the offer complete rate. The most crucial element determining the offer view rate is the promotional channel. The offer type and duration have an impact on the offer completion rate.

##### Increase the number of views
* The organization should be sure to distribute offers to all customers via social media (particularly those between the ages of 18 and 35, who saw more than 60% of the offers).
* If funds allow, offers should be sent to the majority of customers (particularly those with incomes ranging from $45,000 to $105,000) via email and mobile apps.
* To save money, website offers should only be given to clients with earnings more than $75,000. (For further information, see the Appendix.)

##### Imorove completion rate (of views on offers)
* Send more 'discount' offers than other sorts since clients of all ages, genders, and economic levels enjoy them.
* Allow customers a reasonable amount of time (up to 10 days) to complete their offers.


#### What are the suggested tactics for different customer groups?

* Most Valuable Customers: The organization must ensure that they are kept and that customer satisfaction is maintained.
Customers in this category should be pleased with what the organization is doing right now. Small changes can be tried in order to make them feel special. On their birthday, send them a card and vouchers, or treat them and their family and friends on special occasions such as Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Halloween, and so on.

* Regulars: the organization must retain them while also attempting to enhance their Average Purchase Value.
Make them buy more products in addition to the drink they usually buy. Send them offers with discounts on cakes or sandwiches when they buy any drink, for example. Customers may always get their favorite drink (a standard Americano or a big latte). By giving customers offers to buy seasonal beverages at a discount or by adding toppings or syrup to their go-to drinks for free, the firm may motivate them to buy more variety (and better value) drinks.

* High-potential: They have the potential to become the most valued customers. The firm should concentrate on boosting the frequency of their purchases.
Send them more offers (since they are generally sensitive to offers) or treat them to a free drink to show them how much the firm appreciates them. Keep them informed, send them Newsletters (with their permission), and keep them up to date on exciting new goods and unique events.

* Offer-Viewers: some of them have the potential to become High-Potentials.
Send them hard-to-resist offers on a regular basis. From huge discount offers to free things that appear great on social media. This should aid in the formation of their first purchase habit.

* Low-Engagers: they are either loyal to other brands or do not purchase hot beverages on a regular basis.
It would be difficult to win them with traditional promotions. They may be drawn only by unforeseen happenings.
